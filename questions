in typescript, object properties are locked-in
can't add or take away properties
why is this an advantage? 

typescript has to be compiled down to javascript
what are some different ways this occurs? 
how does it happen in react? 

let ninjaTwo: object = {
    name: 'mario',
    age: 30,
    beltColour: 'hi'
}

let ninjaTwo = {
    name: string = 'mario',
    age: number = 30,
    beltColour: string = 'hi'
}

why can't I type + assign object properties?
